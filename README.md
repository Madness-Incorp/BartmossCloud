This project is a simple and efficient file transfer server that I developed for my college work. Since I frequently switch between two laptops, I needed a reliable, free and easy way to transfer files between them. This server acts as a middleman running on a laptop, allowing me to seamlessly send and recieve files from either laptop

Features being worked on:

Send and recieve files easily between a laptop and the server.
Simple setup from the client end to send and recieve
Cross-Device support for mac and linux
A simple GUI interface to allow the user to choose a file they would to install from the server
Terminal text interface for use on the server.
Logs on both sides to keep track of usage.
Future Features
